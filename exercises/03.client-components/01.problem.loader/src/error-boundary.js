// 🦉 normally you won't have to add a 'use client' for third party modules that
// are obviously client-only like this, but there's a bug in react-error-boundary
// for now, so we're going to add 'use client' to this module and that will make
// react-error-boundary only available in the client as well.
// https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary/issues/182

// 🐨 add the 'use client' pragma here
'use client'

// 🐨 export everything from react-error-boundary
export * from 'react-error-boundary'
